Models and notes for a half-day session on teaching modeling growth in Stock Synthesis

Not yet sure how GitHub will work for this use.

Modeling growth in stock assessments using the Stock Synthesis modeling framework

A half-day session held on Monday (November 3rd) afternoon by Ian Taylor
Outline
* Parameterization of growth curves
   * Overview of how many growth parameters are estimated in typical assessments
   * Specification of von Bertalanffy growth curve in SS
   * Specification of length variability around the mean growth curve
   * Treatment of male growth as offsets from female growth
   * Growth between birth and first reference age
* Overview of example models
   * Length comps and conditional age-at-length comps (yelloweye-like model from simulation analysis for paper on growth platoons -- but without growth platoons)
   * Age comps and mean length-at-age observations (simplified mackerel from Paul)
   * Mean weight-at-age with no growth (simplified hake assessment)
* Timing issues
   * Start of year vs. mid-year growth, fleet timing
   * Seasonal models and birth seasons
      * This is going to change in SS version 3.3, perhaps some preview can be provided
* Quantities that depend on growth and how they are connected
   * Growth curve, 
   * Length-at-age matrix, 
   * Length compositions, 
   * Mean length- or weight-at-age
   * Conditional age-at-length compositions
* Advanced topics
   * Empirical weight-at-age matrix
   * Time-varying growth
      * Annual deviations
      * cohort-specific deviations
   * Alternative growth curves
      * Richards (or is it Schnute)
      * age-dependent K
   * Seasonal and spatial 
   * Growth platoons and growth morphs
